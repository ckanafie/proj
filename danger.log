1. We don't have any specific character constraints for user password.
2. We don't do email verification to confirm the legitimacy of the registering user.
3. Forms don't have error checking from the developer side, although we do have Django security support.
4. We don't have password reset. Password might become stale and if account is compromised, the user won't be able to recover it.
5. No protection for DoS and DDoS attack attempts.
